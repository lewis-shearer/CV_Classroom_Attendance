# 🎓 Classroom Attendance Tracker with Computer Vision


Welcome to the Classroom Attendance Tracker! This is a full-stack web application hosted on Firebase that uses Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database for secure CRUD operations. The app leverages TensorFlow.js for real-time computer vision, enabling automatic attendance marking through facial recognition.

# 🚀 Features
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
- Realtime Database: Store and retrieve attendance records instantly.
- Computer Vision: Facial recognition powered by TensorFlow.js for attendance marking.
- Cross-Platform: Works on modern web browsers without additional installations.
- CRUD Operations: Manage student records with create, read, update, and delete functionality.


# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Firebase Realtime Database
